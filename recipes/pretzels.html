    <h2>Addictive sourdough soft pretzels!</h2>
    </ol>

    
    <p>Soft, tasty hand-rolled and twisted soft pretzels made with the touch of sourdough. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g sourdough starter</li>
        <li>255g water</li>
        <li>40g honey</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>500g flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Water bath ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
    </ol>

        <li>2 tablespoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Egg wash</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg or olive oil (if vegetarian)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the sourdough starter, water, honey and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and use your hands to bring the ingredients together as much as possible.</li>
        <li>The dough should be nice and stiff, use a dough hook on the mixer and mix the dough on lowest
            speed for about 6 to 7 minutes or hand knead for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let it rest at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours</li>
        <li>Use a clean work surface and divide 8 to 16 pieces depending on the size you want.</li>
        <li>Roll out each piece to a long rope and make a "U" shape. Lift the ends of the rope and twist 2
            times, fold the twist over and press the ends on the dough to create the pretzel shape. Cover
            the dough with a towel and let rise for 30 to 60 minutes or until puffy.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 218 degrees celcius. Boil the water in a large stockpot and add your baking soda
            and dark brown surgar.
        </li>
        <li>Boil the pretzels, 3 - 4 at a time, on both sides for 30 seconds each, making sure not to crowd the pot.
            use a mesh strainer to remove the pretzels and place back on the baking paper. Brush each pretzel with egg
            wash and sprinkle with salt.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the pretzels at 218 degrees for 12 - 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
